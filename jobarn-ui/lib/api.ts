        <h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters for Small Businesses</h2>
        <p>Small businesses are increasingly becoming targets for cybercriminals. With limited resources and often inadequate security measures, they present attractive opportunities for attackers. However, implementing basic cybersecurity practices can significantly reduce your risk.</p>
        
        <h2>Essential Security Measures</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Strong Password Policies</h3>
        <p>Implement strong password requirements and consider using password managers to generate and store complex passwords securely.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Regular Software Updates</h3>
        <p>Keep all software, including operating systems and applications, up to date with the latest security patches.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Employee Training</h3>
        <p>Educate your employees about common cyber threats such as phishing emails and social engineering attacks.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Data Backup</h3>
        <p>Regularly backup your important data and test your backup systems to ensure they work when needed.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Network Security</h3>
        <p>Secure your network with firewalls, secure Wi-Fi configurations, and network monitoring tools.</p>
